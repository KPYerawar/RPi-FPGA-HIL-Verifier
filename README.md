# ðŸ”Œ RPiâ€“FPGA 4x1 MUX Hardware-in-the-Loop Verifier

Automated **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)** testing setup that connects a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** to an **FPGA board** via **PMOD interface** to test a **4x1 multiplexer (MUX)** design in real hardware.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

This project implements a simple yet powerful **real-hardware verification system** for an FPGA-based 4x1 MUX.  
Instead of verifying logic only in simulation, the **Raspberry Pi** sends live test vectors to the FPGA pins and reads the output â€” performing **true silicon-level verification**.
